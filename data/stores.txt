It’s a mixed bag in his opinion so all the imps cost the same. Imps cost [1d20/1.33] GP each, half this if it’s raining. On purchase the imp is bound to the character until the imp’s unique demise.

Once a year, she closes up shop for a much deserved vacation, and returns with an armful of oddly specific wards.

Mirrors hang from almost every surface, with some even dangling from the ceiling or the bottom of other mirrors.

An observant customer will notice that some mirrors occasionally reflect fantastic locations with startling realism.

Ketterman typically sells to the upper class, but as long as you can pay he’s more than willing to work with just about any customer. But here’s the catch: Ketterman is actually an accomplished diviner as well. Every time he carves an eye into his stonework he can use those eyes to scry through at any time. Ketterman uses his vast network of eyes to spy on anyone within their gaze, and if he comes across something particularly noteworthy he sells that knowledge to the highest bidder, or uses it as leverage for blackmail under his assumed alias of ‘The Emerald Pool’ (because his eyes are green). Ketterman has been operating for almost two decades now, and his work has traveled far across the land. Odds are his stone eyes have seen something you didn’t want to be seen. So tell me friend; what are you hiding?
